# nary_ram_project
This is Mask Detection and an Automatic Attendance System using face recognition , this is team project consisting of me Naresh and Sriram.

For Attendace System :
1. Main Library Used : face_recognition.
2. Model Used : Hog

For Mask Detection :
1. Main Library Used : Tensorflow
2. Model Used : MobileNet

Project report and more detailed readme.md will be updated soon after presentation.

File/Folder Usage:
1. detectFace folder contatains pre-trained face recogniton model for mask detection.
2. MasterUi : Streamlit based Ui that contains Mask Detection and Attendance System.
3. attendance.csv : This csv file is generated by the Attendance System.
4. camera.py : Mask Detection Application.
5. face_2 : Training program for Attendance System.
6. face_3 : Attendance System application.
7. face_feat_extr_accuracy.ipynb : Roc and noc graph for Attendance System.
8. lossANDaccuracy.png: Loss and Accuracy graph while training the Mask Detection.
9. mask_trained.model : Mask Detection model generated in traning phase of mask detection(trianing_script.py).
10. usermanagement.db : Login credentials DB for streamlit UI.
